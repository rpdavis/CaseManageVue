# 🔒 Secure Feedback System - Individual Case Manager Ownership

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2025  
**Security Level:** High - Individual Ownership & Access Control

## **🎯 Overview**

This system provides **complete security and privacy** by giving each case manager their own individual:
- **Google Form** (owned by the case manager)
- **Google Sheet** (owned by the case manager) 
- **Google Doc** (owned by the case manager)

**No shared resources** - each case manager has complete control over their feedback data.

## **🔐 Security Architecture**

### **Individual Ownership Model:**
```
👤 Case Manager A
├── 📝 Form A (owned by A)
├── 📊 Sheet A (owned by A)
└── 📄 Doc A (owned by A)

👤 Case Manager B  
├── 📝 Form B (owned by B)
├── 📊 Sheet B (owned by B)
└── 📄 Doc B (owned by B)

👤 Case Manager C
├── 📝 Form C (owned by C)
├── 📊 Sheet C (owned by C)
└── 📄 Doc C (owned by C)
```

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ **Case Manager owns their files** - Full control
- ✅ **No cross-access** - Can't see other case managers' data
- ✅ **Google account ownership** - Files owned by their Google account
- ✅ **Secure authentication** - Firebase Auth + Google API permissions

## **🔄 How It Works**

### **1. Admin Setup Process:**
```
1. Admin creates "template form" with questions
2. Admin runs "Create Case Manager System" for each case manager
3. System automatically:
   - Copies template form for each case manager
   - Creates individual Google Sheet for each case manager
   - Creates individual Google Doc for each case manager
   - Transfers ownership to case manager's Google account
   - Stores metadata in Firestore for tracking
```

### **2. Case Manager Usage:**
```
1. Case Manager clicks feedback button on student
2. System loads their personal feedback system
3. Case Manager can:
   - Send their personal form to teachers
   - View their personal response sheet
   - View their personal summary document
4. All data stays within their ownership
```

### **3. Data Flow:**
```
Teacher fills form → Responses go to case manager's sheet → 
Case manager's doc gets updated → All within their ownership
```

## **🚀 Technical Implementation**

### **New Cloud Functions:**

#### **1. `createCaseManagerFeedbackSystem`**
**Purpose:** Creates individual feedback system for a case manager
**Authentication:** Admin roles only
**Parameters:**
```javascript
{
  templateFormUrl: string,    // Admin's template form
  caseManagerEmail: string,   // Case manager's email
  caseManagerName: string     // Case manager's name
}
```

**What it does:**
1. **Copies template form** using Google Drive API
2. **Creates individual sheet** with Summary + Template tabs
3. **Creates individual doc** with initial content
4. **Transfers ownership** to case manager's Google account
5. **Stores metadata** in Firestore for tracking

#### **2. `getCaseManagerFeedbackSystem`**
**Purpose:** Gets current case manager's feedback system
**Authentication:** Any authenticated user
**Returns:** Case manager's personal form, sheet, and doc URLs

### **New Firestore Collection:**

#### **`caseManagerFeedbackSystems`**
```javascript
{
  caseManagerId: string,        // Case manager's email
  caseManagerName: string,      // Case manager's name
  formId: string,              // Google Form ID
  formUrl: string,             // Google Form URL
  spreadsheetId: string,       // Google Sheet ID
  spreadsheetUrl: string,      // Google Sheet URL
  documentId: string,          // Google Doc ID
  documentUrl: string,         // Google Doc URL
  createdAt: timestamp,        // Creation timestamp
  createdBy: string            // Admin who created it
}
```

### **New Frontend Components:**

#### **`SecureFeedbackDialog.vue`**
**Purpose:** Secure interface for case managers to access their feedback system
**Features:**
- **Loads personal system** - Only shows case manager's own files
- **Send feedback form** - Uses their personal form
- **View response sheet** - Links to their personal sheet
- **View summary document** - Links to their personal doc
- **Security indicators** - Shows ownership and privacy status
