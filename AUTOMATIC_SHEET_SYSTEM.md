# 🤖 Automatic Google Sheet System with Student Tabs

## **Overview**

This system automatically creates Google Sheets for feedback forms with a smart tab-based organization:

- **One Sheet per Form**: Each feedback form gets one Google Sheet
- **Multiple Tabs per Student**: Each student gets their own tab within that sheet
- **Summary Tab**: Overview of all students and their response status
- **Template Tab**: Standard structure for all student tabs

## **📊 Sheet Structure**

```

## **🔄 How It Works**

### **1. Form Creation (Admin)**
```
1. Admin creates Google Form manually
2. Admin adds form to system via Admin Panel
3. System automatically creates Google Sheet with:
   - Summary tab (form info + student tracking)
   - Template tab (standard structure)
4. Sheet is linked to the form in Firestore
```

### **2. Form Usage (Case Manager)**
```
1. Case Manager selects student and form
2. System automatically:
   - Creates new tab for that student (if doesn't exist)
   - Updates Summary tab with student info
   - Sends form to teachers
3. Teachers fill out form
4. Responses go to student's specific tab
```

### **3. Response Management**
```
1. All responses for a student are in their dedicated tab
2. Summary tab shows overview of all students
3. Case Manager can easily:
   - View individual student responses
   - Compare responses across students
   - Generate documents from specific tabs
```

## **🚀 Technical Implementation**

### **Cloud Functions:**
- `createFeedbackFormSheet`: Creates initial sheet with Summary and Template tabs
- `sendTeacherFeedbackForm`: Creates student tab when form is sent
- `createStudentTab`: Creates individual student tabs with proper structure

### **Sheet Structure:**
```javascript
// Summary Tab
A1: "Feedback Form: [Title]"
A2: "Description: [Description]"
A4: "Created: [Timestamp]"
A6:E6: ["Student Name", "Tab Name", "Response Count", "Last Response", "Status"]

// Template Tab
A1:G1: ["Timestamp", "Teacher Name", "Student Name", "Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3", "Additional Notes"]

// Student Tab (e.g., "John Smith")
A1:G1: ["Timestamp", "Teacher Name", "Student Name", "Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3", "Additional Notes"]
A3: "Student: John Smith"
```
