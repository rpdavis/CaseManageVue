## 📁 **Firebase Storage Security Rules Implementation (COMPLETED)**

The Firebase Storage ruleset has been successfully implemented with cross-service Firestore lookups for secure file access:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Cross-service validation with Firestore
    function getStudentDoc(studentId) {
      return firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/students/$(studentId));
    }
    function studentStaffIds(studentId) {
      return getStudentDoc(studentId).data.app.staffIds;
    }
    
    // Secure file access rules
    match /students/{studentId}/sensitive/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        isSuperAdmin() || 
        request.auth.uid in studentStaffIds(studentId)
      );
      allow write: if request.auth != null && (
        isSuperAdmin() || 
        (userRole('case_manager') && request.auth.uid == studentCaseManagerId(studentId))
      );
    }
  }
}
```
