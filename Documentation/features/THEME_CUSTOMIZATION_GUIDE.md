## Technical Details

### CSS Variables
The theme system uses CSS custom properties (variables) that are applied to the document root. This ensures:
- Consistent theming across all components
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Efficient rendering and performance

### Database Storage
Theme settings are stored in Firestore under `app_settings/theme` and include:
- All color values
- Typography settings
- Border radius values
- Timestamp of last update

### Browser Compatibility
The theme system works in all modern browsers that support:
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- HTML5 color inputs
- File API for import/export

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Loading
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase connection
3. Try refreshing the page

### Changes Not Saving
1. Ensure you have admin permissions
2. Check internet connection
3. Verify Firebase write permissions

### Import Issues
1. Ensure the file is a valid JSON format
2. Check that all required theme properties are present
3. Verify the file was exported from this system

## Security Considerations

- Only users with admin permissions can modify themes
- Theme data is validated before saving
- Import files are validated for security
- All changes are logged with timestamps
