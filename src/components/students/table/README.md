# StudentTable Refactor - Steps 1-4

## Overview
This refactor extracts helper functions and table cells from the monolithic `StudentTable.vue` into modular components and composables for better code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Step 1: Extract Helper Functions to Composable
- Created `useStudentTable.js` composable in `src/components/students/table/`
- Moved all helper functions from `StudentTable.vue` to the composable:
  - User mapping functions (`getUserName`, `getUserInitials`, `getUserInitialLastName`)
  - Date formatting and urgency functions (`formatDate`, `getDateUrgencyClass`, etc.)
  - Student data extraction functions (`getCaseManagerId`, `getFlagValue`, `hasFlags`, etc.)
  - Schedule processing functions (`getSchedule`)
  - Services processing functions (`getClassServices`, `getOtherServices`, `hasServiceProviders`, etc.)
  - Paraeducator assignment functions (`isDirectAssignment`)
  - Utility functions (`formatListFromText`, `getFlagClass`)

### Step 2: Create Table Folder Structure
- Created `src/components/students/table/` directory
- Added `index.js` barrel export for clean imports
- Updated `StudentTable.vue` to use the composable instead of inline functions

### Step 3: Extract Table Cell Components
- Created individual cell components for better modularity:
  - `StudentInfoCell.vue` - Student name, grade, case manager, dates, flags
  - `ServicesCell.vue` - Class services and related services
  - `ScheduleCell.vue` - Student schedule display
  - `AccommodationsCell.vue` - Instruction and assessment accommodations
  - `DocumentsCell.vue` - Document links (At-A-Glance, BIP)
  - `ActionsCell.vue` - Edit, email, and teacher feedback buttons

### Step 4: Create External CSS File
- Created `StudentTable.css` with all table-related styles
- Extracted styles from the monolithic component
- Organized styles by component type (badges, flags, buttons, etc.)

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and styling are separated
2. **Reusability**: Helper functions and cell components can be reused
3. **Testability**: Functions and components can be unit tested independently
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
5. **Code Organization**: Related code is grouped together
6. **Modularity**: Each cell component has a single responsibility
7. **Styling**: CSS is centralized and easier to maintain

## File Structure
```
src/components/students/
├── StudentTable.vue (simplified - uses composable and cell components)
└── table/
    ├── index.js (barrel export)
    ├── useStudentTable.js (composable with all helper functions)
    ├── StudentTable.css (external styles)
    ├── StudentInfoCell.vue (student info display)
    ├── ServicesCell.vue (services display)
    ├── ScheduleCell.vue (schedule display)
    ├── AccommodationsCell.vue (accommodations display)
    ├── DocumentsCell.vue (documents display)
    ├── ActionsCell.vue (action buttons)
    └── README.md (this documentation)
```

## Usage
The `StudentTable.vue` component now imports and uses the composable and cell components:

```javascript
import { useStudentTable } from './table'
import { 
  StudentInfoCell, 
  ServicesCell, 
  ScheduleCell,
  AccommodationsCell,
  DocumentsCell,
  ActionsCell 
} from './table'

// In setup function
const {
  getUserName,
  formatDate,
  getSchedule,
  // ... other functions
} = useStudentTable(props)
```

## Cell Component Props
Each cell component receives the necessary data and functions as props:

- `student`: The student object
- `currentUser`: Current user object (where needed)
- `appSettings`: App settings object (where needed)
- Helper functions from the composable

## Next Steps
Future refactoring steps could include:
- Creating separate composables for specific domains (schedules, services, etc.)
- Adding TypeScript for better type safety
- Creating a testing suite for the composable and cell components
- Adding accessibility improvements
- Creating a design system for consistent styling
