# Environment Configuration Fixes

## üö® Issues Found

The production environment was experiencing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors due to environment configuration problems introduced during the Firebase projects setup.

### Root Causes:
1. **Wrong Firebase Project**: Production build was connecting to development project (`casemanagevue-dev`)
2. **Environment Variables Not Loading**: The environment-based configuration wasn't working properly
3. **No Authentication**: Users couldn't authenticate due to incorrect project configuration

## üîß Files Modified and Reverted

### Files Changed from Original Repository
Based on comparison with [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rpdavis/CaseManageVue):

#### 1. `src/firebase.js` ‚úÖ **REVERTED**
- **Issue**: Changed from hardcoded config to environment variables
- **Fix**: Reverted to original hardcoded Firebase configuration
- **Result**: Now uses correct production project (`casemangervue`)

#### 2. `src/composables/useGoogleSheetsClient.js` ‚úÖ **REVERTED** 
- **Issue**: Changed from hardcoded API keys to environment variables
- **Fix**: Reverted to original hardcoded Google API configuration
- **Result**: Google Sheets integration working again

#### 3. `src/components/UserTable.vue` ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Spread operator syntax error in production build
- **Fix**: Refactored spread operator usage in `getProviderLabel` function
- **Result**: Production build compiles successfully

#### 4. Environment Files ‚úÖ **CREATED**
- **Created**: `.env.production` with correct configuration
- **Purpose**: For future environment-based configuration when properly implemented

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Working**
- **Production Build**: Compiles successfully
- **Firebase Configuration**: Uses correct production project (`casemangervue`)
- **Authentication**: Should work with original configuration
- **Google Sheets API**: Uses original hardcoded keys

### üîÑ **Environment Configuration Strategy**

The environment-based configuration approach was correct in principle but caused issues due to:
1. Vite environment variable loading timing
2. Build process not properly substituting variables
3. Missing fallback mechanisms

### üìã **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Test Production**: Verify authentication and permissions work at http://localhost:4173
2. **Gradual Migration**: Implement environment variables one service at a time
3. **Add Fallbacks**: Ensure environment variables have hardcoded fallbacks
4. **Separate Development**: Use development project only for actual development work

## üõ†Ô∏è **Working Commands**

```bash
# Production (Fixed)
firebase use production
npm run build
npm run preview
# Access: http://localhost:4173

# Development (Multiple instances running)
firebase use development  
npm run dev
# Access: http://localhost:5173-5179 (check multiple ports)
```

## üìù **Lessons Learned**

1. **Gradual Changes**: Environment configuration should be implemented incrementally
2. **Testing**: Each change should be tested in both development and production
3. **Fallbacks**: Always maintain working fallbacks during transitions
4. **Original Working State**: Keep reference to original working configuration

## üîÆ **Future Environment Setup**

When re-implementing environment configuration:
1. Start with development environment only
2. Add proper fallback mechanisms
3. Test thoroughly before applying to production
4. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
5. Maintain backward compatibility
